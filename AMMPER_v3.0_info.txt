AMMPER v3.0 Info


AMMPER (Agent-based Model for Microbial Populations Exposed to Radiation) 
is a simulation tool used to model radiation-induced DNA damage 
and repair in eukaryotic cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). It is designed 
to act as an educational tool and to facilitate early-stage planning 
of space radiaiton biology experiments. AMMPER is inspired by the BioSentinel 
project, and incorporates biological ground testing data as well as radiation 
measurments taken by the CubeSat's linear energy transfer (LET) spectrometer.




Key Features (v3.0):

Simulates cell health outcomes (healthy, damaged, apoptotic, necrotic) 
over multiple generations after radiation exposure

Allows choice between several radiation types, basic or complex ROS, 
and number of starting cells (1-300)

Visual output includes cell grid plots per generation

Generates CSV data for each generation with full cell state tracking
(Position, generation, health)




New in Version 3.0:

Probabilistic Repair Logic Overhaul:
All new probabilistic cell repair logic and multiple repair attempts per generation

    Cumulative Damage Modifier:
    Accounts for increased difficulty of repair success after prolonged damage retention cause by 
    factors such as: 
    stalling of repair protiens at telomeres, protien pathway fatigue, oxidative stress

    Strand Break factoring:
    The amount of Double and Single strand breaks present now has a direct 
    effect on repair outcomes

    Cell Cycle Phase Effects:
    Repair success depends on the simulated cell cycle phase (G1, S, G2, M)

New radiation types:
Inclusion of FE-56, O-16 ions and 1 GEV Protons
    All energy deposition and track data was generated from Geant4 radiation 
    simulations and has been validated to ensure accurate energy-enviornment
    interactions.

    Several new RadData files awaiting full integration



Use Cases:

Educational demonstrations of radiation effects on cells

High-level screening of variable combinations for experiment design

Preliminary assessment of biological payload requirements




Issues and Notes (To be fixed in furture versions): 

AMMPERGUI:
AMMPERGUI.py, AMMPERrunsGUI.py and AMMPERCLI.py all currently work, but are 
not updated for compatability with AMMPER v3.0 and may yeild errored results.
To use the simulation, it is recommended that the master AMMPER.py script is run 
directly.

New Radiation Types: 
FE-56, O-16 ions and 1 GEV Proton radiation types require further testing and 
integration. They may give unrealistic outputs, however, their energy depositions are 
pulled from accurate data.
